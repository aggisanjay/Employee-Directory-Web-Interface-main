## 🛠️ Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- No additional dependencies required

### Running the Application
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser
3. The application will load with sample employee data



## 💻 Technology Stack

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup and modern web standards
- **CSS3**: Flexbox, Grid, animations, and responsive design
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: ES6+ features, DOM manipulation, and event handling
- **Freemarker**: Template structure (simulated for client-side development)

## 🔧 Core Functionality

### Employee Management
- **Add Employee**: Complete form with validation
- **Edit Employee**: Pre-filled form with existing data
- **Delete Employee**: Confirmation dialog for safety
- **View Employees**: Card-based layout with all essential information

### Search and Filtering
- **Real-time Search**: Instant results as you type
- **Department Filter**: Filter by HR, IT, Finance, Marketing, Sales
- **Role Filter**: Filter by Manager, Developer, Analyst, Coordinator, Specialist
- **Combined Filters**: Multiple filters work together

### Pagination

- **Smart Navigation**: Previous/Next buttons with page numbers
- **Status Information**: Shows current range and total count

### Form Validation
- **Required Fields**: All fields must be completed
- **Email Validation**: Proper email format checking
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Prevents duplicate email addresses
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear error messages and field highlighting

## 📱 Responsive Design

The application is fully responsive with breakpoints for:
- **Desktop**: > 1024px - Full featured layout
- **Tablet**: 768px - 1024px - Adapted layout for touch
- **Mobile**: < 768px - Stacked layout with optimized controls

## 📊 Data Management

The application uses a local JavaScript array to simulate employee data:
- **Mock Data**: 25 sample employees with realistic information
- **In-Memory Storage**: Changes persist during the session
- **No Backend**: Pure client-side implementation

## 🔍 Code Quality

- **Modular Structure**: Organized into logical modules
- **Clean Code**: Well-commented and readable
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error management
- **Performance**: Optimized DOM manipulation and event handling

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

Given more time, the following improvements could be implemented:

### Technical Improvements
